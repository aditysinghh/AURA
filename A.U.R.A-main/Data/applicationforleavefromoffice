Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be requiring a leave of [number] days from [start date] to [end date]. I have a personal commitment that I must attend to during this period, and I will be unavailable to come to the office.

I will ensure that all my tasks are up-to-date and completed before my leave, and I will make arrangements for my work to be covered during my absence. If there are any urgent matters that need my attention, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding in this matter. I will be available by email if anything urgent comes up while I am away.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,

Aditya Singh Ji
